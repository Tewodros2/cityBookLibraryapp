      <p>Fairfield Public Library is located in Fairfield, Iowa, United States. A library association was founded by a
        group
        of local men in 1853, and funded by dues from its members. It was housed in several different buildings for the
        first 40 years. U.S. Senator James F. Wilson from Fairfield was instrumental in obtaining a grant from Andrew
        Carnegie for a building of its own. The grant for $40,000 was accepted on January 15, 1892.[2] It was the first
        Carnegie Library outside of Western Pennsylvania and the first of 101 built in Iowa.[3] It was also one the few
        libraries Carnegie funded without stipulations concerning its use, public support, or design. The building was
        designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style by Kansas City architect C. Stafford. It was officially opened on
        Friday, September 29, 1893, and it was dedicated on November 28 of the same year. The association continued to
        run
        the library until 1899 when voters approved a referendum to support it with taxes. The building has been altered
        in
        the ensuing years, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.[1] The library moved
        to a
        new building in 1996, and the historic building is now home to the Jefferson County Service Center of Indian
        Hills
        Community College.</p>
